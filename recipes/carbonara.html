  <h2 class="carbonara description">Description</h2>
  <p>This is the recipe of Pasta Carbonara after multiple trial and error. To be honest I used to prepare it with cream but this has changed since I moved in with Angelo, from Palermo. 
    It is the mixtue of the eggs and the cheese that creates this creamy textue and cream is not needed.</p>
  <p>The following recipe is what I consider the best carbonara recipe and I am a fan of Pasta Carbonara. It takes only 20mn to prepare. <strong>I hope you guys enjoy it :)</strong></p>
